# data-analysis
Projects involving data cleaning in SQL, Excel, and data visualizations in Tableau and Power BI.
📌 Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset containing information about tech layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The raw data included inconsistencies, null values, and irrelevant columns that needed to be addressed for meaningful analysis. Using SQL, I transformed this unstructured data into a clean, analysis-ready format.

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
1) SQL (MySQL)
2) Data Cleaning & Transformation
3) Null Handling
4) Duplicate Removal
5) Column Optimization
6) Standardization Techniques

📈 Key Cleaning Steps
1) Removed null values from critical columns to ensure data reliability.
2) Standardized text fields (like company names, locations) for uniformity.
3) Removed duplicate entries using CTEs and window functions.
4) Dropped irrelevant or low-information columns to enhance dataset clarity.
5) Ensured consistent formatting across all fields.

📂 Files Included
layoffs.raw data.csv – The original, unprocessed dataset

layoffs.clean data.csv – The cleaned and transformed version

Data cleaning project in SQL.sql – SQL script with step-by-step cleaning operations

✅ Outcome
The final cleaned dataset is well-structured and ready for insightful analysis on trends, company-wise layoffs, and COVID’s impact on the tech industry. This project highlights my ability to work with real-world messy data and prepare it for deeper analytical use cases.
